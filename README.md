ü©∫ Symptoms-based Diabetes Prediction

This project focuses on predicting the likelihood of diabetes in individuals using symptoms and health-related data through machine learning models. 
Diabetes is a growing global health issue, and early prediction plays a vital role in prevention and management.

üìä Dataset
The dataset includes medical attributes such as:
- Glucose level  
- Blood pressure  
- BMI (Body Mass Index)  
- Age and other health-related features  

The target variable indicates whether the individual is diabetic (`1`) or not (`0`).
‚öôÔ∏è Methodology
1. Data Preprocessing & Exploration
   - Loading the dataset and checking distributions.  
   - Data visualization using Matplotlib and Seaborn.  

2. Model Training
   - Logistic Regression  
   - Decision Tree Classifier  
   - Random Forest Classifier  
   - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)  

3. Model Evaluation  
   - Accuracy Score  
   - Confusion Matrix  
   - Classification Report (Precision, Recall, F1-score)  

üìà Results
- Among the tested models, Random Forest Classifier provided the highest accuracy and robustness.  
- Logistic Regression and KNN also performed well but were less consistent compared to ensemble methods.  
- The project demonstrates that symptom-based prediction can be an effective way to identify individuals at risk of diabetes.
